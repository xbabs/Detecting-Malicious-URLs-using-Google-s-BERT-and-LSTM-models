# Detecting-Malicious-URLs-using-Google-s-BERT-and-LSTM-models
In this project, I developed and compared two models, LSTM and Pre-trained BERT, for the task of detecting malicious webpages. The dataset used for training and evaluation was unbalanced, consisting of 522,214 entries with a train-test split of 70% to 30%.
